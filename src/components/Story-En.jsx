      &nbsp; Imperial soldiers have captured Ulfric Stormcloak and are preparing
      to execute him, along with the player who was caught up in the skirmish
      and mistakenly believed to be a rebel. Before the player can be executed,
      Alduin appears, attacking the imperial outpost and thus rescuing the
      player. The player escapes and warns Jarl Balgruuf of Whiterun of the
      dragon attack. When another dragon attacks and is slain, the dragon's soul
      flows into the player character, causing the nearby guards to call them
      "Dragonborn". The Greybeards summon the Dragonborn to the Throat of the
      World, where the Dragonborn begins training in the Way of the Voice.
      <p></p>
      &nbsp; Delphine intercepts the Dragonborn on a training quest and arranges
      for the Dragonborn to infiltrate the Thalmor Embassy in Solitude, on the
      (mistaken) suspicion that the Thalmor are responsible for the dragon
      attacks. There, they learn that Esbern, a Blades lore master obsessed with
      the prophecy of Alduin's return, is alive and hiding in Riften. The
      Dragonborn rescues Esbern from Thalmor agents. Esbern leads them to an
      ancient Blade temple and a massive engraving depicting Alduin's prior
      defeat. Esbern deciphers that the ancient Nords used a special shout to
      remove Alduin's ability to fly and render him vulnerable.
      <p></p>
      &nbsp; Arngeir does not know the shout, which is called Dragonrend and
      violates the Way of the Voice. Arngeir sends the Dragonborn to Paarthurnax
      at the summit of the Throat. Paarthurnax reveals that no one living knows
      Dragonrend, but theorizes that the Dragonborn could learn it by looking
      through time at the summit, the site of Alduin's banishment. To do this,
      the Dragonborn retrieves the Elder Scroll used in the banishment from a
      massive subterranean Dwemer city. The Dragonborn returns to the summit and
      learns Dragonrend. Alduin attacks. The Dragonborn uses Dragonrend, and
      together with Paarthurnax overpowers Alduin, who flees.
      <p></p>
      &nbsp; The Dragonborn's allies hatch a plan to capture a dragon at
      Whiterun. The Dragonborn helps negotiate a truce in the civil war to
      prevent either side from capturing Whiterun during this delicate
      operation. The captured dragon, Odahviing, questions whether Alduin
      deserves lordship over dragons. He reveals that Alduin has gone to recover
      his strength in Sovngarde, the Nord afterlife, where he feeds on the souls
      of the dead. Since the portal to Sovngarde cannot be reached on foot,
      Odahviing bargains his freedom in exchange for flying the Dragonborn
      there. Entering Sovngarde, the Dragonborn meets the three heroes who had
      defeated Alduin originally. With their help, the Dragonborn kills Alduin
      and returns to Skyrim.
